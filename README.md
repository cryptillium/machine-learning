# Machine-Learning

The purpose of this project is to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. 

This project will demonstrate different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes by making use of the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques.<br><br>
