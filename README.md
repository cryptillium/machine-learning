# Machine-Learning

The purpose of this project is to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. 

This project will demonstrate different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes by making use of the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using various techniques<br><br>

we will look at the following methodology of training:
   - Naive Random Oversampling
   - SMOTE
   - Combination Over and Under Sampling (SMOTEENN)
   - Cluster Centorids Sampling (undersampling)
   - Simple Logistic Regression
